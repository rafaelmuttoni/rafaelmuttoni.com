It was previously being implemented through a Google Sheet. In the Web App we developed extra features, such as setting your habit's frequency to help you organize your day, adding an Accountability Partner to help you keep up with your habits and many others. Feel free to try the app, we are really proud with the result so far! It's a work in progress, we will wait for your feedbacks.`,

It has a good set of functionalities, from the most basic such as storing clients, services and appointments to creating your own calendar, so the clients can schedule on their own, where you can customize days and time range. You can also integrate your Telegram to receive daily reminders of appointments and expenses. Last but not least you can send reminders to your clients' (email or whatsapp) with a link that contains a token so the user can confirm or cancel the appointment by themselves. It's a SAAS integrated with Stripe.`,

    description: `A Web App built for a Condo Manager who also works as a Lawyer.
    This project was built with React and Material UI (using Material Kit's boilerplate). It's using Axios to communicate with the API, FullCalendar (with Moment) for an awesome Calendar/Schedule and React-pdf for automating PDF creation.

    Some cool features for improved User Experience: 1️⃣ The application has a Context with a State that stores a information about which condo is selected (the default is All Condos), so the user can select a specific condo and all the dashboard information will be related to the selected condo. 2️⃣ When the user is creating a condo, after inputing the zip code the application makes a GET request to Via Cep's Api to get address information and automatically fills some of the inputs.

    description: `Worked with the team at Zaply to develop a SAAS Web App for the food industry called Recipe2Basket. My main role was to develop this React App, which I had the opportunity to make it from scratch, it had to be a fully custom app because we needed to embed it in our clients' websites. In this Widget I used React with Styled-components. Besides this product, I also developed other React Apps to help our internal processes, where I used Material UI components.
    We were a small team, so I got the chance to get out of my comfort zone, developing and fixing issues across all our software stack. I have worked with NodeJS (Express and Adonis), MySQL and AWS.
